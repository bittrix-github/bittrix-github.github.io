        <p>Hey there!&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp=)<br>Welcome to my web dev portfolio.</p>
        <p>I am Pedro Bittencourt and this is the breakthrough to my new professional era. I've always been this kind of person that is never quite satisfied with steady states, so here I am again, craving for novelties.</p>
        <p>I was once (for a reasonable while) a Physics teacher, but after nine years + I decided to call it quits in 2018. Long story short, unfortunately I simply wasn't able to find any kind of excitement in that duty anymore. I just hit the ceiling of professional growth and found myself wandering from class to class, not being able to foresee a fruitful future. Maybe I started out too soon, I'm not really sure.</p>
        <p>Combined with that, I was just graduated an electrical engineer out of Rio de Janeiro State University - Uerj - and was full of hopes and dreams of seeking career success again. I can only tell you it was nothing like that. I had to learn the hard way that infrastructure job market is way low right now in Brazil. For the past five or seven years now, actually.</p>
        <p>I had these incredible opportunities with temporary jobs and was really happy at a workplace again, the greatest one being this experience to participate in the construction of a thermal power plant in Tres Rios (upstate Rio de Janeiro). The site was up for 10 months and ended up being the gateway to a formal job for me. I was hired three months later, by the same spanish company, to work as an operator on another runing thermal power plant, this time in Barra Mansa (another city in the state of Rio de Janeiro).</p>
        <p>Moved away for the job, so I was half happy, half heartbroken for being far away from home and all the ones I love and care. This cycle ended 9 months later, september 2021, after the company endured some financial problems.</p>
        <p>Well... maybe the universe had some other plans for me.</p>
        <p>I have been in touch with programming/development in a casual form since my first time in college, something like 14 years now. Of course nothing that deep, just making myself able to play around with some features in Fortran95 - back in the Physics years - then Pascal, MatLab, Arduino and C during my engineering degree.</p>
        <p>Inspired and convinced by my girlfriend, who is one heck of a UI/UX Designer, late 2021 saw me choosing to try and approach a whole new career. She led me into discovering a bit of how a front-end developer works and encouraged me into believing I might actually make a good one out.</p>
        <p>As a matter of fact, I ended up realizing my problem-solving skills thrived through the years, especially by being a physicist and an engineer, what could in effect be a strong positive for me. And, simply put, I was really excited about working with this new area - for me, at least - of technology.</p>
        <p>So, december 2021 I started formally studying and learning web development (100% self-taught though, as I did most definitely my entire life) and february 2022 I began reuniting my projects and building this portfolio.</p>
        <p>Really, really hope you enjoy the material.<br>Sorry if I extended myself a little bit too much here, but I am kind of super thrilled about all this.</p>
        <p>Down there you can check my simplified resumé, a more complete version is up on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedro-bittencourt-a66869188/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

        <p><br><br><br>Kind regards,<br><br>Pedro.</p>
