        <p>Bugs are here as an inventory of my current struggles and future pathes in this journey of becoming a front-end developer.</p>
        <p>I try and organize this tier list to prioritize subjects I'm guessing are the most important for my learning curve and general knowledge in development.</p>

            <h3>01. Mobile responsiveness</h3>

            <p class="p__left"><ion-icon name="phone-portrait-outline" id="now-phone"></ion-icon> At this very moment, my foremost commitment is to master the making of web apps that can respond perfectly in any kind of mobile device. We all know how phones came to be the dominant form of access for web pages, so that's why it is currently the biggest dot on my radar.</p>
            <p class="p__right"><ion-icon name="logo-sass" id="now-sass"></ion-icon> I'm starting to track fast and functional tools, like Sizzy and Blisk, to help me simultaniously emulate several responsive versions of my web apps. I'm guessing Sass might actually come handy here, so I'll continue getting used to write CSS stylesheets via Sass until it's second nature.</p>
